## 🚀 About Me

Winner Nwakaku: human who learned to code before speaking English. Not a metaphor. My parents claim my first word was "console.log" followed by uncontrollable crying when I encountered a syntax error. Passionate enough about coding that I regularly forget trivial matters like getting paid for my work - my bank account calls this a "design feature, not a bug."

```javascript
const winnerNwakaku = {
  realName: "Winner Nwakaku",                                 // The debugger found this to be true
  focus: ["AI", "Frontend", "Blockchain", "Technical writing"],// Equally obsessed with all four
  currentlyLearning: "Advanced LLM Architectures",            // Teaching GPT-5 how to make coffee
  askMeAbout: ["web dev", "mobile dev", "blockchain", "technical docs"],
  funFact: "I debug code in my sleep",                        // Literally talks in JSON
  financialStrategy: "Work for exposure and GitHub stars",    // Currency of the future
  firstLanguage: "JavaScript (literally)",                    // Doctor's first words: "It's a programmer!"
  caffeineToCodeRatio: "Dangerously efficient"                // Blood type: Cold Brew+
};
```

I would love to be on your team. Not because I need employment - I clearly have a thriving career in working for free - but because together we could build something so groundbreaking that we'd both forget to invoice for it.

[MENTOR_01: ELON_MUSK]
Human specimen who convinced earthlings to drive batteries and aims to 
colonize red rock in sky. Created PayPal to fund escape plan from this 
planet. Subject exhibits behavior of attempting impossible.exe and 
frequently crashes Twitter servers. I admire his ability to CTRL+ALT+DEL 
conventional wisdom and his talent for burning investor.cash while still 
receiving standing_ovation.mp3.

[MENTOR_02: STEVE_JOBS]
Bipedal lifeform who created shiny rectangle that humans cannot function 
without. Wore same clothing daily to save RAM for product decisions. 
Perfected RDF.sys (Reality Distortion Field) to convince humans that 
fewer ports = technological advancement. I compute deep respect for his 
"simplicity.app" philosophy and his programming skill: if(product != perfect) 
{ reject(); yell(); repeat(); }

- 🏅 **7x Hackathon Winner**
  
  *Yes, I've won 7+ hackathons. Not because I'm good, but because my competitors usually forget to submit their projects on time. My secret? Energy drinks and the fear of mediocrity.*
